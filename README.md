# Project restful API
## Product Recommendation Based on Your Holiday's Destination

This repository is created as part of a team project during Alterra Academy Software Engineer bootcamp. We were asked to create a RESTful API project using Flask in 5 days. 

The idea of this project can be described in this diagram:

This project uses 4 APIs: 
| No | API |
| --- | -------- |
| 1 | [Amazon Price](https://rapidapi.com/ajmorenodelarosa/api/amazon-price1) |
| 2 | [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api) |
| 3 | [Currency Converter](https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/currency-converter5) |
| 4 | [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) |


Developer:
Andre Novado and [Derby Prayogo](https://github.com/derbyps)

P.S:
Because we used the free trial for the Amazon Price API, this program will not work unless you subscribe to this API.
